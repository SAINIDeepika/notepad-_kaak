Based on the information you've provided, it looks like your **User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)** currently has the **Key Vault Data Access Administrator** role. However, this role might not be sufficient for performing encryption operations such as wrapping and unwrapping keys. 

### Steps to Fix the Issue:

#### 1. **Assign the Proper Roles for Encryption**

You should assign additional roles that specifically allow key management and cryptographic operations.

1. **Add Key Vault Crypto User or Key Vault Contributor Role**:
   - Go to the **IAM Role** page of the Key Vault.
   - Click **+ Add** > **Add role assignment**.
   - Under **Role**, select one of the following:
     - **Key Vault Contributor** (provides full access to manage the Key Vault, including keys and secrets).
     - **Key Vault Crypto User** (only allows key operations like wrap, unwrap, encrypt, and decrypt).
   - **Assign to the User-Assigned Managed Identity**:
     - Under **Assign access to**, select **Managed identity**.
     - Search for and select your **User-Assigned Managed Identity**.
   - Click **Review + assign** to complete the role assignment.

#### 2. **Verify Current Permissions for User-Assigned Managed Identity**

Make sure that the following permissions are available for the **User-Assigned Managed Identity** in your Key Vault:
- **List**: Allows listing keys.
- **Get**: Allows fetching the keys for encryption.
- **Wrap/Unwrap Key**: Required for encryption and decryption operations.
  
The **Key Vault Crypto User** role covers these permissions, but you can also check this in **Key Vault** under **Permissions** for keys to ensure these operations are allowed.

#### 3. **Retry the Azure Data Factory Creation**:

Once you've assigned the correct roles, retry the creation of the Azure Data Factory instance. Ensure the following:
- **Encryption settings** in the Data Factory setup reference the correct **Key Vault URL**.
- The **User-Assigned Managed Identity** is selected and linked correctly.

### Summary:

You should:
- Assign either **Key Vault Contributor** or **Key Vault Crypto User** role to the **User-Assigned Managed Identity** for the Key Vault.
- Ensure the managed identity has the correct permissions for key management (especially **wrap** and **unwrap** operations).
- Retry the Azure Data Factory instance creation.

These steps should fix the "CMKInvalidParameters" error by ensuring the identity has the necessary key permissions. Let me know if you need further assistance!
