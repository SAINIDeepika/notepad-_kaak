Since your **Azure Data Factory (ADF) instance deployment has failed** due to the "Encryption settings contain invalid parameters (Code: CMKInvalidParameters)" error, you won’t be able to associate the **User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)** directly through the ADF instance until the deployment succeeds. Instead, you can handle the configuration outside of the ADF instance itself.

Here are the steps you should follow to resolve the error by using the **User-Assigned Managed Identity** for Azure Data Factory and fixing the **Key Vault** access issue:

---

### Step 1: Assign the User-Assigned Managed Identity to the Key Vault

1. **Go to the Key Vault**:
   - Open your **Azure Key Vault** in the Azure portal.

2. **Access Control (IAM)** for Key Vault:
   - In the Key Vault’s sidebar, go to **Access Control (IAM)**.

3. **Add Role Assignment**:
   - Click **+ Add** and choose **Add role assignment**.
   - In the role selection, choose either:
     - **Key Vault Administrator** (Full control over Key Vault, including keys and secrets).
     - **Key Vault Reader** (Only has read access to keys and secrets, sufficient for accessing keys for encryption).
   
4. **Assign the Role to the User-Assigned Managed Identity**:
   - Under **Assign access to**, select **Managed identity**.
   - In the **Select managed identity** section, choose the **User-Assigned Managed Identity** that you created earlier.
   - Click **Review + assign**.

### Step 2: Redeploy Azure Data Factory with User-Assigned Managed Identity

Now that the Key Vault access issue is handled, we’ll proceed to deploy Azure Data Factory (ADF) with the **User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)** to manage the encryption key from Key Vault.

1. **Create a New Azure Data Factory Instance**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to **Azure Data Factory** and click **+ Create**.

2. **Fill in Basic Settings**:
   - Select your **Subscription** and **Resource Group** (bluehq_group).
   - Provide a name for your Data Factory instance and choose the appropriate **Region** (e.g., **West Europe**).

3. **Networking** (Optional):
   - Set up any virtual network or private endpoint if needed (can be skipped for now).

4. **Select User-Assigned Managed Identity**:
   - In the **Managed Identity** section:
     - Choose **User-Assigned Managed Identity** and select the one you created earlier (which has access to the Key Vault).
   
5. **Encryption Settings**:
   - In the **Encryption** section, enable **Customer Managed Key (CMK)** and provide the **Key Vault URL** where the encryption key is stored.
   - Since your user-assigned managed identity already has access to the Key Vault, this should resolve the encryption-related error.

6. **Review + Create**:
   - Review the settings and click **Create** to redeploy your Data Factory instance.

---

### Step 3: Verify the Deployment

After the deployment succeeds, go back to the **Azure Key Vault** and verify that the Azure Data Factory can access the encryption keys as required.

---

### Summary

- You have assigned your **User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)** to the **Key Vault** with the correct permissions.
- You redeployed the Azure Data Factory instance and linked it to the **User-Assigned Managed Identity**, resolving the encryption settings error.

This approach should resolve the **CMKInvalidParameters** error and successfully deploy your Data Factory instance. If you encounter any further issues, let me know!
