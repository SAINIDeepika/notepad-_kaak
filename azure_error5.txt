The error you're encountering, **"Encryption settings contain invalid parameters (Code: CMKInvalidParameters)"**, is related to permissions and configuration around the Key Vault and Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) that Azure Data Factory (ADF) uses. Specifically, the error suggests that the User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) either doesn't have the correct Key Vault permissions or there might be a mismatch in configuration.

To ensure that your User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) has the correct permissions for accessing the Key Vault, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Verify the Key Vault Access Policies for UAMI
In Azure, the **Access Policies** section of your Key Vault defines the permissions for accessing keys, secrets, and certificates. For encryption and decryption purposes, the UAMI must have specific permissions.

Here’s how you can verify that:

#### 1.1 Check Key Vault Access Policies:
1. Go to the **Azure Portal**.
2. Navigate to your **Key Vault**.
3. In the left-hand menu, click on **Access Policies**.
4. Look for the **User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)** you are using.
5. Ensure the following key permissions are present:
   - **List**: Allows listing the keys in the vault.
   - **Get**: Allows fetching the key (required for encryption).
   - **Wrap Key**: Required to wrap (encrypt) data.
   - **Unwrap Key**: Required to unwrap (decrypt) data.

   If these permissions are missing, follow these steps to add them:
   - Click **Add Access Policy**.
   - In the "Configure from template" section, choose "Key Management".
   - In the **Permissions** for keys, ensure that **List**, **Get**, **Wrap Key**, and **Unwrap Key** are checked.
   - Under **Select principal**, search and select the User-Assigned Managed Identity.
   - Save the changes.

#### 1.2 Check Key Vault Role Assignments (RBAC):
Make sure that the **Key Vault Contributor** and **Key Vault Data Access Administrator** roles are assigned correctly, but note that **Access Policies** are the primary method for Key Vault access control in this case. Double-check these roles in the **Access Control (IAM)** section for completeness.

### Step 2: Verify Key Vault Access via UAMI in ADF

#### 2.1 Check if ADF is using the correct UAMI:
1. Go to the **Azure Data Factory** instance in the Azure Portal.
2. In the left-hand pane, navigate to **Managed Identity**.
3. Ensure the **User-Assigned Managed Identity** is enabled and listed there.

#### 2.2 Verify Encryption Settings:
1. In the ADF instance, go to **Encryption Settings**.
2. Check that the **Key URI** (the identifier for the encryption key in the Key Vault) is correctly specified and points to a valid key.
3. Ensure that the UAMI is configured to access this specific key within the Key Vault.

### Step 3: Test the UAMI Permissions
To ensure the UAMI has the right access, you can use Azure CLI or PowerShell to perform actions such as listing and fetching the key.

#### 3.1 Test with Azure CLI:
```bash
# Sign in with UAMI
az login --identity --username <UAMI-ID>

# Try to list keys in the Key Vault
az keyvault key list --vault-name <YourKeyVaultName>

# Try to fetch the specific key
az keyvault key show --vault-name <YourKeyVaultName> --name <YourKeyName>
```

#### 3.2 Test with Azure PowerShell:
```powershell
# Authenticate with UAMI
Connect-AzAccount -Identity

# List keys in the Key Vault
Get-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName "<YourKeyVaultName>"

# Fetch a specific key
Get-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName "<YourKeyVaultName>" -Name "<YourKeyName>"
```

### Step 4: Debug Further
- If you see no issues in permissions but still get the error, check the Key Vault’s **Azure Diagnostics Logs** for any failed access attempts. This might provide more detailed error information.
- Additionally, check if the key itself has any restrictions or policies that might prevent access.

By following these steps, you should be able to verify whether the User-Assigned Managed Identity has the correct permissions for accessing the Key Vault and the Customer-Managed Key (CMK). This will likely resolve the `CMKInvalidParameters` error.
