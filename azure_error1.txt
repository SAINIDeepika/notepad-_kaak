The error **"Encryption settings contain invalid parameters (Code: CMKInvalidParameters)"** indicates that there is still an issue with the configuration of the encryption settings. Since you've already assigned the **User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)** to the Key Vault and granted it the appropriate role, we’ll need to ensure that other potential issues are addressed.

### Here's a detailed checklist to ensure everything is set up correctly:

---

### 1. **Double-Check Key Vault Access Permissions**

Make sure the **User-Assigned Managed Identity** has **Key Management** permissions in the Key Vault. The **Key Vault Data Access Administrator** role may not be sufficient for key operations (like encrypting/decrypting) required for Azure Data Factory. You need to grant **specific permissions for key access**:

1. **Key Vault IAM Role**:
   - Ensure that the **User-Assigned Managed Identity** has been assigned either:
     - **Key Vault Contributor** (full access to manage keys, including encryption/decryption).
     - **Key Vault Crypto User** (permissions to encrypt/decrypt with the key).
     - **Key Vault Administrator** (full permissions, including keys and secrets).
   - The **Key Vault Data Access Administrator** role is typically not sufficient for key encryption tasks.

2. **Key-Specific Permissions**:
   - If possible, assign the following permissions **directly to the key** using **Key Vault Access Policies** (if using Access Policies instead of RBAC):
     - **Get**: Allows Data Factory to retrieve the encryption key.
     - **Wrap Key / Unwrap Key**: Required for encryption and decryption.
     - **List**: To view the key.

3. **Verify Key Vault Access Policies** (if applicable):
   - Even though you're using **RBAC**, if your Key Vault is configured to use **Access Policies** instead of RBAC, ensure the following permissions:
     - **Key Permissions**: Select **Get, List, Wrap Key, and Unwrap Key**.
     - Assign these permissions to the **User-Assigned Managed Identity**.
   - Go to your Key Vault > **Access policies** > **Add access policy** > **Select principal** and choose your **User-Assigned Managed Identity**.

### 2. **Check Key Vault URL in Encryption Settings**

Ensure that the Key Vault URL entered in the **Encryption Settings** is correctly formatted. It should look like this:
```
https://<your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net/
```

- Ensure there are **no trailing spaces** or extra characters in the URL.
- Make sure the **key version** is specified correctly if you're using a specific version of the key.

---

### 3. **Verify the Key is Enabled and Exists**

Go to the **Keys** section of your Key Vault and verify that:
- The key you want to use for encryption is listed and **enabled**.
- The key is in the correct **RSA format** (which is usually required for encryption).
- If you're using a specific version of the key, ensure that version is still active.

---

### 4. **Check Key Vault Network Configuration**

If your **Key Vault** has firewall rules or **Virtual Network (VNet) integration** enabled, ensure that:
- **Azure Data Factory** can access the Key Vault.
- If the Key Vault is restricted to a specific network, ensure that Data Factory is part of the allowed VNet or has been granted **exceptions**.

---

### 5. **Test the Access Manually**

To confirm that the **User-Assigned Managed Identity** has access to the Key Vault, you can test it using **Azure CLI** or **Azure PowerShell**.

1. Open **Cloud Shell** in the Azure Portal.
2. Run the following command to check if the **User-Assigned Managed Identity** can access the Key Vault key:

```bash
az keyvault key show --vault-name <your-key-vault-name> --name <your-key-name> --subscription <your-subscription-id>
```

If the key is returned without any access error, then the identity has the correct permissions. Otherwise, you will see an error indicating what permissions are missing.

### 6. **Review the Key Vault Configuration for CMK**

If all the above checks are correct and the problem persists, it could be related to the specifics of the **Customer Managed Key (CMK)** configuration. Ensure the following:
- **CMK is correctly configured** in the Key Vault.
- The **Data Factory region** and **Key Vault region** are the same (recommended for performance and compliance).
- You’re not using an unsupported key version or format (e.g., unsupported elliptic curve keys).

---

### Final Steps:
After verifying all these settings and making sure the **User-Assigned Managed Identity** has the correct permissions and access to the Key Vault, retry creating your Azure Data Factory instance with the Customer Managed Key (CMK) settings.

If the issue persists, please let me know which specific step caused difficulty or if you receive a different error message during the redeployment. This will help narrow down the root cause.
